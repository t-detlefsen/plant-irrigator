# DIY Automated Plant Irrigator
This repository is for the automated watering of a single plant using an ESP32 communicating with a Raspberry Pi over MQTT. The system can be controlled and monitorred using a web interface using Node-RED.

This branch contains the code to be deployed onto the arduino.
